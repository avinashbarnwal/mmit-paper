Max margin interval trees

** TODOs
*** Experiments

- Does CV model comparison with targets result in the same conclusions
  as if we used the actual label error function? Yes, in the case of
  all open intervals and only one label per segmentation problem
  (neuroblastoma data set). Try with detailed labels, and ChIP-seq
  data sets, to see if same conclusions hold.
- Does the linear model learn faster than the tree model? Fix a test
  set, then plot test accuracy versus number of labeled segmentation
  problems.

26 penalty learning data sets created via [[file:data.sets.R]]

- R pkg neuroblastoma + labels.
- http://members.cbio.ensmp.fr/~thocking/neuroblastoma/signal.list.annotation.sets.RData
  this data contains many different types of microarrays -- maybe
  create a data set that groups them all together?
- thocking@guillimin:PeakSegFPOP/ChIPseq.wholeGenome.rds contains
  features + targets for genome wide ChIP-seq segmentation models
  (PeakSegFPOP and PeakSegJoint).
- TODO copy 7 benchmark data sets from work computer. TO benchmark web
  page. Scripts to compute [[https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegFPOP-paper/blob/master/PDPA.targets.R][targets]] and [[https://github.com/tdhock/PeakSegFPOP-paper/blob/master/problem.features.R][features]].

prediction, margin and slack.

[[file:figure-penaltyLearning.R]] visualizes cost as a function of feature
value.
